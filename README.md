# Helium Monitor

A Helium Monitor application for Nebra miners

It monitors your nebra miner health status in intervals and notifies you in case your miner misbehaves.
After you install the Helium monitor it will ask you for you device IP address. (Press change to commit the changes)

It goes into tray icon (load's at startup) and the tray icon should change to red if your miner has an error.
Also it will popup a small dialog and play an alarm sound.

btw, the installer is big because it has chrome embed libraries inside for the hellium explorer.
