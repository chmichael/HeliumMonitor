# HeliumMonitor

A Helium Monitor application for Nebra miners

It monitors your nebra miner health status in intervals and notifies you 
in case your miner misbehaves.

After you install the Helium monitor it will ask you for you
device IP address. (Press change to commit the changes)

It goes into tray icon (load's at startup) and the tray icon should
change to red if your miner has an error.

btw, the installer is big because it has chrome embed libraries inside for the hellium explorer.

SSH monitoring is in works ....
